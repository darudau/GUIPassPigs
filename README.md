# GUIPassPigs
Pass the Pigs is an implementation of the Game Pass the Pigs with an AI Player

This game was developed as part of an Artificial Intelligence course at Bethel University.

The AI's "though process" is based off the expected value of rolling the pigs.  The AI's "thoughts"
are printed out to demonstrate how the AI is making its decisions.
